I'm trying out the 'make a manual post via Jekyll' thing today so that I can work a bit retrospectively on my blog and capture the recent journeys.

It has been a busy month outside of the coding world - running the Melbourne node of Global Gov Jam (and hosting the Global HQ) and leading up to GovHack.

I haven't quite made it to five hours of coding a day yet, but this just means that I need to reassess my ambitious 'code in six months!' goal and figure out what is actually realistic.


Today:
Javascript - playing around in Github
Time Spent: (at time of this entry, 1 hr).
