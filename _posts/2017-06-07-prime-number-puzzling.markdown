Yesterday I managed to work through about six or seven labs on Ruby via the Learn.co platform, getting used to the idea of yields and collections in Ruby. I'm now at the lab where one needs to determine if a number is a prime number.

I got stuck at this point and ready to sleep on it and my partner asked me if I wanted to have a clue to mull on in my sleep, if I wanted to iterate through a process to figure out if a number was prime. These were some of the prompting questions that I could frame my code around:

What's the smallest even prime number? (2).
If you continued to subtract 2 from any odd number, what would you eventually get? (1).
If you continued to subtract 2 from any even number, what would you eventually get? (0).

So with these priming (ha) questions in mind, time to start thinking about the iterations ...

Today:
Ruby. And math.
Time Spent: today? just getting started.
