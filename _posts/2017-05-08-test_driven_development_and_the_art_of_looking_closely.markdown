I'd somewhat prided myself on my sharp eye for detail. A few years in several roles in image processing meant I honed the skill of scanning over images that flashed by as quickly as my mind could process and my fingers could type. As a result, I had developed the art of the copy-edit, the ability to look at someone else's text and play spot-the-typo.

But my fingers sometimes type faster than my head, which is why I am grateful for test-driven development (TDD), because those tests designed to teach and point out those slight mistakes make me a better coder.


Although this is my first blog post I've been re-learning how to code in the latest and greatest through via Flatiron School's Learn.co platform, after winning a half-scholarship from Hackernest (insert hat-tip here). It has been a few days since I've managed to sit with my blocked-out period of five hours to really focus on the code.

I learned to code front-end fumbling around in the joy that was Geocities, scrolling text, awkward colour combination, and - yes - frames. My coding tool of use, when it wasn't Notepad, was [Arachnophilia](http://https://arachnoid.com/arachnophilia/index_old.html), which was actually kind of a joy to use, and I have a vague recollection of letting a five-year-old use my computer and teaching her a bit of HTML front-end with Arachnophilia as well - she made a pink site with lots of different coloured text. Now, of course, we have [Lego Minecraft working with Code.org](http://https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/user_ed/2015/11/17/teach-kids-to-code-with-minecraft-and-code-org/) - I may or may not be dying to code along.

I mean, if there are tools out there that can help you with that, then why not?


So I'm most comfortable and up to date on front-end web development, having had a long history going through the different versions of HTML in various formats, as well as working through many company intranets and creating Wordpress pages for fun and for fun. It's why I'm actually spending the most time at the moment digesting Ruby - making sure that I learn the bits and pieces - and appreciating the usefulness of TDD.

Because every time I hit 'learn' and get that gratifying little flash of green saying that my tests have passed, but occasionally there's that one little line that comes up red, I can wear my copy-writer hat and look back at my code and think about what I missed. Usually I can spot it. 

As I continue on I'd prefer to code more consciously rather than let my fingers lead the way, so in combination with the Learn.co course I am also going through learning [Ruby the Hard Way](https://learnrubythehardway.org/). This blog will cover my adventures.


There is a '[Maniac Mondays for the Month of May](http:/http://forum.beeminder.com/t/maniac-mornings-in-the-month-of-may/3160/)' thing going on via one of my favourite apps, and although I'm not actively tracking my coding hours through Beeminder at the moment, over the next couple of days as I catch up with blog posts and coding I'll work through the coding journey here.
