I've been enjoying learning HTML5 because there are lots of things which are updates from what I learned in those early days of Geocities and Crosswinds, and I'm going to write a bit of a 'blast from the past' series because I found a bunch of old and (probably) sloppy code and have another look at it in the context of the new HTML.
