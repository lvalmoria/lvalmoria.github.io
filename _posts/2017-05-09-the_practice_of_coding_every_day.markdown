I'd committed to doing some coding every day since starting this journal, and thus, reading about classes and instance methods in Ruby which is being taught in a very cute way on Learn.co - defining dogs.

I mean:

```
fido = Dog.new
fido.bark #> "Woof!"
```

This. Adorable.


Discovered to my delight yesterday that the code.org site offers a '[Learn to code with Elsa and Anna](http://https://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1)' - which is basically like the turtle graphics I remember from computer labs in school, modernified and given a Frozen twist.


Activity-wise, I'm on board for helping out with the Melbourne node of [GovHack](http://https://govhack.org/), a hackathon using government open data sets. We are just gearing up for a few months of organisation, but for next week, I'll be throwing my hat in as facilitator and all around operations person at [Global GovJam 2017](http://http://www.govjam.org/), which will be hosting the [Global HQ in Melbourne](http://http://www.govjammelb.org/).

Finding time around activities has been a little bit crunchy, but leading with the commitment to get at least an hour of coding done has meant that I'm focused on sitting down and actually doing the thing. It's the making of time, even if it's just navigating my way around Jekyll so I can start to make more posts using this tool. It also means that, as I slowly learn the ropes of Ruby, I can start to look at definitions and words in a more conscious way than I have in the past. More on this to come.

Just started: Object Orientation in Ruby.
